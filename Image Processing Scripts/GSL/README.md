# Image Comparison: Input vs GSL Processed Image + ARISE

This page aims to compare the input and output of the GSL model processed image + applying ARISE algorithm on the processed image.

## Input Image

The input image is the original image that is fed into the GSL model. The input image is shown below:

## GSL Processed Image after ran through ARISE

Output generated by the GSL model changing the background to yellow and applying ARISE algorithm on the processed image.
